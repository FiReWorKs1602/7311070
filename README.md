# INF_Maturita
This project is designed to help students preparing for the INF Maturita exam. You can use these codes directly or refer to them as examples. However, I donâ€™t recommend simply memorizing them; understanding the logic behind the code is much more important. I will include explanations of the logic within each piece of code to aid your understanding.

### caveat
During file operations, my file paths might differ from yours. (my file paths will be in the same directory as the current working environment and code).
```python
f = open("text1.txt", "r") 
comtext = f.read()
f.close()
```
